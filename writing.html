            I’m the author of a novel published by Henry Holt &amp; Co. The New
            York Times called it “smart and diverting.”

            Library Journal thought it “filled with keen social commentary, this
            debut novel is an inspired reimagining of Edith Wharton's The House
            of Mirth. More than a century later, the theme still echoes that in
            women's relationships, there is too high a cost to not staying true
            to oneself.

            Texas Monthly said, “Puig’s ear for dialogue is unassailable.” This
            one especially made me glad because the story takes place in
            Houston, my hometown.

            I haven’t been creating essays for publication lately (maybe I will
            again, sooner or later), but my writing has made appearances in
            Salon, The Texas Observer, and Variety, among others.

            Here is one of my favorite essays about the secret love of Edith
            Wharton’s life. Written after a writing residency at The Mount,
            Edith’s home in Lenox, Massachusetts. A very special two weeks of my
            life.
